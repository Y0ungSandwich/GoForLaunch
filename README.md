# Go For Launch
Go For Launch is a space exploration modpack on the ATLauncher and Twitch App

Go For Launch Outline:
Setting: An alien attack has used some sort of weapon of mass destruction on Earth(Overworld). The weapon has wiped out most humans, much of the wild life, has turned most of the world into vast Deserts, evaporated almost all water and as an effect some how poisoned the ocean and river biomes. A heavy green fog hangs above poisoned area. Special equipment can protect you from entering these areas to scavenge what little dirt and grass is available for seeds and food to survive. Most Ores will have been vaporized. What does remain is very low in the world and in extremely low quantities. You will discover that straining the water yields you nuggets of precious metals and gems. 

Goal: GFL will have a goal of getting off the Earth and into space exploring whichever planets you wish. Each planet to prove to have its own challenges, bosses, hostile creatures, and hostile atmospheres. 
After leaving Earth you are to find a home planet and setup a sustainable environment to live in.  There is no set end game. You can continue on exploring the world(s) as well as returning to Earth with better                         technology and skills to survive and maybe find a way to remove the poison from the world and bringing back some of the lush biomes you remember.  
        
Mod structure: All tech with NO magic. Recipes HEAVILY altered to include the use of multiple mods and cross mod integration.  Several tiers of space travel will exist. You will need to progress through each tier to get to the next but some tiers are not necessary and are just there for looks or added functionality, quality of life, or ease of use.  Most recipes will not be what you are used to and you will need to check JEI before crafting. A large advancement inclusion will help guide you through the mission but will not reward any items for completion.
